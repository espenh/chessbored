# Chessbored library
Chessbored is a chessboard component.

This is currently just a heavy-handed TypeScript conversion of the chessboard.js component by Chris Oakman, available at [chessboardjs.com].
The api is almost identical, but will change over time.

## Installation
```
npm install chessbored
```

## Development
To build and watch:
```
npm install
npm run watch
```
